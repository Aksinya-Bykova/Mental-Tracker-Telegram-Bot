# Mental-Tracker-Bot

This is my toy project as a part of [Mental Wellness Hackathon 2024](https://hackformental.com/)

Telegram-Bot is available as [@mental_tracker_bot](http://t.me/mental_tracker_bot)

1. Watch [data analysis sample](https://github.com/Aksinya-Bykova/Mental-Tracker-Telegram-Bot/blob/main/samples/Data-Analysis-Sample.ipynb) to discover the method
2. You need to set config.py and create your own creds.json using google API. If you speak russian, you can use [this guide](https://youtu.be/JByWnTMH3WU?si=19gcaMPC_u9BfxJT). Some code was taken here
```
settings = {
    'TOKEN' : '',
    'CREDITS_NAME' : 'creds.json',
}
```

```
user_settings = {
    'TABLE_URL' : '',
    'CHAT_ID' : ''
}
```
3. Now works on a local machine. You can watch video demonstration, contact me or build by your own. Maybe I will try to run it on a free server
